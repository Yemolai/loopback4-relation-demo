# lb4-relation-test

This is a repo of a Loopback4 Model Relation test.

Using LoopBack4 CLI 1.14.1 the relation was created only with CLI commands. Just a type correction was made in the filter types of the controller queries and the addittion of free-form properties into the model classes to avoid errors.
